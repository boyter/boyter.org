I'm a software developer by trade who after years of leaving articles and blog posts all over the place has finally gotten around to consolidating them all into this single site.

I am a professional software engineer who has been working in development with a focus on testing for over 15 years. In that time I have played an integral part in developing and implementing testing methodologies for all sorts of projects including,

* Internal web based applications supporting thousands of users
* Customer facing websites with 10&#8217;s of millions of uniques a day
* Large financial applications handling multi billion dollar projects
* HR applications for 10&#8217;s of thousands of employees dealing with sensitive information
* Internal desktop applications used across company groups connecting to centralised servers
* Highly performant web service endpoints supporting entire businesses
* ETL systems processing millions of records every hour
* Backend integration with SAP for large energy providers
* Large scale deployment and management of AWS services and systems

Some notable projects and blog posts of mine,

  * [https://searchcode.com/][2] A source code search engine
  * [https://searchcodeserver.com/][10] Run searchcode.com on your own cloud
  * [Decoding CAPTCHA&#8217;s][3] an article about decoding CAPTCHA&#8217;s
  * [The Great Benefit of Test Driven Development Nobody Talks About][4]
  * [Why You Shouldn’t roll your own CAPTCHA][5]
  * [Code a search engine in PHP][6]

Also here are a few press write ups I have received for my project searchcode.com, with most of the details provided by myself

  * YourStory &#8211; [How this Aussie coder is making life easy for techies around the world with searchcode][7]
  * Sphinx Blog &#8211; [Sphinx Searches Code at Searchcode.com][8]
