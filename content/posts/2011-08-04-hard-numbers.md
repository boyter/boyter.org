Thought I would quickly post some hard numbers showing the number of searches since searchco.de launched. The results surprised me somewhat actually. 2011-7 13636

  * 2011-6 8154
  * 2011-5 6183
  * 2011-4 8532
  * 2011-3 10886
  * 2011-2 6476
  * 2011-1 948

I could dig into the results more closely since a lot of those could be the ajax firing off events like "a" and the like but I do like the upwardish trend.
