Every few years I have a habit of starting a new project. The goal always being to scratch my own itch and learn some new technology in the process. While I am still working on searchcode.com I really wanted to play with what I had learnt there and apply it to something new.

Recently I have been taking an interest in various topics such as &#8220;[Oil Gas Pipeline Failure Rates][2]&#8221; and &#8220;[Hydroelectric Dam Environmental Impacts][3]&#8221; (both generated using Portfold). My standard workflow was enter a search term into my favorite search engine and then click through the results looking for the interesting information. Extremely time consuming I was looking to find a better way to do it.

The problem as such is that searching for information presents a collection of related blue links. What do you do then?

The result is a project called Portfold. Portfold is form of Topic Research Software. The workflow is pretty simple. You enter some search terms, and a list of results are displayed. Wait for a few moments and the results are pulled down, with all of the information extracted and in a print friendly format. Information such as the number of words and if the result is a PDF are displayed inline. It was built using Django with MySQL for the backend and AngularJS for the frontend making it a single page application.

I am not aware of anyone else solving this issue in this way. This may or may not be a good thing but I am gaining a lot of value from it.

If you would like to see some examples of what sort of reports Portfold can produce please see the following detailed report outputs.
