I was recently selected to present at [DataEngBytes 2023](https://dataengconf.com.au/) after submitting an idea for a talk based on my blog post [Processing 40 TB of code from ~10 million projects with a dedicated server and Go for $100](https://boyter.org/posts/an-informal-survey-of-10-million-github-bitbucket-gitlab-projects/).

I think it went well, other than not having the slides able to present for the first 10 minutes. After 5 mins or so I decided to just plough on since it was less of a visual talk anyway. I did have a few people come to me afterwards and thank me for it which was nice.

For those who did attend sorry about that. You can find all the links for everything below.
