title: Resolve "database is locked" with Go and SQLite

I have always been a big fan of SQLite and recently was using it with Go/Golang. However due to fact that goroutines are very convenient I quickly ran into the "database is locked" issue where multiple writes would try to update the database at any one time. Multiple reads worked without issue.

I could have solved this by throwing a mutex lock around the database writes, but thats something I could easily mess up by missing the mutex and locking the database at the wrong time. I could also have retries with a backoff which isn't a bad idea for resilience, but overkill for my situation.

A better solution and one that is hard to search for online is to limit the number of open connections.

```Go
db.SetMaxOpenConns(1);
```

Setting the above after getting your SQLite database connection will totally resolve the issue. It does in theory lower your read performance, but my brief tests to confirm/deny this didn't indicate any major difference for the sort of load I am expecting.

I was curious about how common this was and checked against [searchcode.com](searchcode.com) [1](https://searchcode.com/?q=lang%3Ago+SetMaxOpenConns+sqlite) and [2](https://searchcode.com/?q=lang%3Ago+db.SetMaxOpenConns%281%29+sqlite). Rather unsurprisingly it seems like a common thing.

Since I had a great deal of issues finding a simple resolution to the problem I thought this post might help someone else.

**EDIT/UPDATE**

While the above works, it limits your reads. I find now that the  best solution in Go is to have two connections. The first being limited to the number of CPU's for reading and another with a single connection for writing. Something like the below achieves this, and ensures you still have excellent read performance while avoiding the aforementioned error.

{{<highlight go>}}
dbRead, _ := connectSqliteDb("dbname.db")
defer dbRead.Close()
dbRead.SetMaxOpenConns(runtime.NumCPU())

dbWrite, _ := connectSqliteDb("dbname.db")
defer dbWrite.Close()
dbWrite.SetMaxOpenConns(1)
{{</highlight>}}

Note that you will need to setup your WAL like the below in order to benefit most from this,

{{<highlight go>}}
_, err = db.Exec(`pragma journal_mode = wal;
pragma synchronous = normal;
pragma temp_store = memory;
pragma mmap_size = 268435456;
pragma foreign_keys = on;`)
{{</highlight>}}

The most important one being `journal_mode = wal` which sets write ahead locking ensuring you can read and write at the same time.

I have been using the above on searchcode.com for a long time now with no issues on a 6.4TB database.
