Welcome. If you are reading this you either follow me on RSS, watch my blog or were directed here at the start of my GopherConSyd 2023 talk about "Bloom Filters: Building a Cutting Edge Go Search Engine to Explore the World's Source Code". Whatever the case may be, welcome!

If you didn't want to talk to me at the event, which I understand as I don't like approaching people either, reach out to me via twitter.com [@boyter](https://twitter.com/boyter) activitypub [@boyter@honk.boyter.org](https://honk.boyter.org/) or email ben@boyter.org I promise I will respond eventually.

For the slides visit https://boyter.org/static/gophercon-syd-presentation-2023/ then just use the space bar to advance, the arrow keys to move around or the ESC key to see everything and then enter to select a slide. Press S to see the speaker notes, which are more or less the script I will be sticking to.

Searchcode itself can be found at https://searchcode.com/

The blog post everything was based off is here https://boyter.org/posts/how-i-built-my-own-index-for-searchcode/ and contains a lot more detail.

For details about bitfunnel this video is excellent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Xoy5w5ydM however the one at the bottom of this page https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/events/mike-hopcroft-microsoft/ is even better with more details. The bitfunnel paper itself can be found here https://danluu.com/bitfunnel-sigir.pdf

For a small implementation you can play around with visit https://github.com/boyter/indexer where there is an implementation of everything you see in the slides you can use locally.
