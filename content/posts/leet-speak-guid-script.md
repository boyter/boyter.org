Some time ago I wrote about creating leet speak guid's as a way of having fun while working with sitecore. https://boyter.org/2014/05/unique-guid/

I recently realised I wanted to have this around so I could create more interesting guids for one reason or another, but couldn't find the script I was using back then. So I created it again, and its now on github as a gist for myself and anyone else to use https://gist.github.com/boyter/6f5b7c1b375e79449d01916f5828e1db feel free to use it as you wish!
