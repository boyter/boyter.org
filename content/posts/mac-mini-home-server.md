title: Running a Mac Mini M2 as a home server

I have always dabbled in running a home server. I ran a AMD Phenom system at home for a long time, but eventually I gave it up due to the power usage and the noise. The fans are one problem you can solve but it had spinning HDD's and a low wife appreciation factor.

I mostly wanted it to run pi-hole on because I like the network wide protection it provides. Until recently I was doing so on an ancient Asus Eee 1000HA netbook which I had running [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) since it supported its rather dated x86 CPU. Because I value any always on machine to be silent, or rather so I cannot hear it it actually lived under the house in possibly the worst possible conditions for a computer. Still it managed to do the job for many years, albeit just as a pi-hole.

Recently I found a link on Hacker News by someone moving to home hosting using a M1 Macbook Air <https://thin.computer/> and decided I would dip my toes back into the self hosting world.

Network was one thing. While I do have fibre to the house, I didn't have a real internet connection due to CG-NAT. Thankfully removing this was as simple as waiting for my ISP tech support to wake up, ask them to remove it and reboot the router.

While I am yet to move this blog or any other site over I am now able to do.
