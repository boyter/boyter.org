title: Moving a MySQL/MariaDB database between servers using SSH

I'm in the middle of moving searchcode.com's database to another server while upgrading it. This means I need to copy it somehow. It's especially difficult in this case because the server its sitting on does not have enough disk space to do my usual `mysqldump` then copy the file across using SCP.

I investigated splitting the database using `--where` clauses allowing me to get chunks of the database across, but that also means adding things like `--skip-create-options` and `--skip-add-drop-table` and I ended up having to redo it a few times, with dumps in between.

I started looking into doing the dump/import directly over mysql through a remote connection, which I am not a fan of because you have to start exposing your mysql instance to the internet, or setup a private network between the new and old severs. Neither are an appealing option.

A bit of searching around however and I discovered you can actually do it using SSH. This turned out to be a total game changer for me, hence writing this blog so I can keep reference to it.

The command is as follows,

```
mysqldump -u username -ppassword db-name | ssh user@remote mysql -u username -ppassword db-name
```

In my case I added some additional options in order to not smash the active MySQL instance, and deal with some of the larger content thats stored in it.

```
ionice -c2 -n7 nice -n19 mysqldump --single-transaction --max_allowed_packet=512M -u user -ppassword db-name | ssh user@remote mysql -u user -ppassword db-name
```

The result? It worked! Very well too. After a few hours the database was replicated and I am now able to finish the migration. All without exposing the database publicly. Bliss.
