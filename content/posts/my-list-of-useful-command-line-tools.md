A post that is constantly a work in progress.

- ripgrep - Similar to grep, but a drop in replacement for large file scanning without unicode penalities. It's also similar to Ag and Ack and optimised for searching code, ignoring .git directories and the like. <https://github.com/burntsushi/ripgrep>
- tmux - Terminal multiplexer. I wrote a [5 min guide](https://boyter.org/posts/enough-tmux-to-be-productive-in-5-minutes/) to this. Use it to have resumable sessions after closing ssh sessions and to have split pane windows.
- bat - Replacement for cat but provides syntax highlighting and line numbers. Can work as a drop in replacement for cat as well as it detects redirects and removes the fancy output. <https://github.com/sharkdp/bat>
- fd - Better than find. Recursively looks for whatever it is you need using regular expressions and like ripgrep ignores .git directories and the like. <https://github.com/sharkdp/fd>
- fzf - Fuzzy finder. Hard to explain why this is so useful. Suggest checking it out <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf>
- gron - Makes JSON files grepable by flattening the structure. Very useful when trying to find something in JSON quickly. <https://github.com/TomNomNom/gron>
- hexyl - Hex view of files with highlighting and the like. Find BOM in files quickly! <https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl>
- hyperfine - A command line benchmark tool. Give it two commands `hyperfine 'scc' 'tokei'` to determine which one is faster. <https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine>
- z - A shell script that enables quick jumping to your most recently used directories. For example I work with scc a lot and its directory is `/c/Users/bboyter/Documents/Go/src/github.com/boyter/scc` which is a pain to remember. Having changed to it a few times I can now type `z scc` and it takes me right there. A massive time saver. <https://github.com/rupa/z/>
- stu - A small TUI application explorer for AWS S3 or any other S3 compatible storage. Very useful when used with localstack `stu --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566` <https://github.com/lusingander/stu>
