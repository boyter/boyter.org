title: Resurrecting Bogan Ipsum

I remember hearing about Bogan Ipsum, which was an alternative to Lorem Ipsum for you know bogan's back in 2011 through [LifeHacker](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/09/strewth-bogan-ipsum-gives-you-aussie-filler-text/). However it since became defunct. I became aware of this fact from Darren at work given the following message on slack?

> Boganipsum where?

Clearly this needed to be rectified! A quick search found this https://www.npmjs.com/package/boganipsum implementation which seemed to work well enough, so I ported it to basic JavaScript (think 2001 style JavaScript) and threw together a quick HTML page. I then registered https://boganipsum.com.au/ and the result?

I improved the nodejs implementation slightly, adding a "Add more aussie" option which is very NSFW and threw in some new phrases. The cherry on top of course is the image, which is a merge of a Simpsons style portrait of myself and Michael Cusack's video [Chuck Her In The Ute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i2eZaJsC7g).

The internet needs more useless things. I am happy to help with this mission.

One thing I did notice is that Bing indexed the page considerably faster than Google, and had it searchable within hours rather than days. Hat's off to the Bing team there.
