title: Simple Go Cache

Happy new year!

I am in the middle of converting searchcode.com over to SQLite, which is a far more interesting future post, and as a result had to rewrite some of the core service logic. The previously implemented code had grown over time so I decided to start fresh. Of course the catch of this is introducing regressions, which I did by stripping out some of the caching logic I had implemented.

I have wanted to make a generic cache for Go for a while as none of the existing ones I had found fit my requirements, which are as follows,

- Have the ability to set a hard limit on the max items, but also allow "infinite" growth
- Have the ability to age out items over time
- Have the ability to keep items forever unless the max cap is found
- Configurable expiration algorithm LRU/LFU and others over time
- Support concrete types (In other words use Go generics)
- Configurable random eviction policy, to trade off time for accuracy and vice versa
- Specific to one concrete type per cache

With the above in mind what I really wanted was Go map, with the expiration. I am fully aware that multiple excellent cache solutions for Go exist, with searchcode using github.com/coocood/freecache as a generic cache but for specific items I more or less wanted some functions over a fancy map.

The result I cleaned up and have released <https://github.com/boyter/simplecache>

Usage is fairly simple. Create a new cache after importing github/boyter/simplecache similar to the below and set the type you want to cache, which in this case is a string. Then get/set/delete as normal.

{{<highlight go>}}
sc := simplecache.New[string]()

v, ok := sc.Get("key-1")
if ok {
 fmt.Println(v) // prints "some value"
}

v, ok = sc.Get("key-99")
if ok {
 fmt.Println(v) // not run "key-99" was never added
}

sc.Delete("key-1") // removes the item

sc.Clear() // clear the whole cache
{{</highlight>}}

You can also configure the cache to meet your own requirements. The default values as of now are 100,000 items, no age expiration, LFU as the expiration algorithm, with 5 samples taken.

All of which are configurable. For example, lets assume you want to limit to 1,000 items.

{{<highlight go>}}
mI := 1_000
sc := simplecache.New[string](simplecache.Option{
    MaxItems: &mI,
})
{{</highlight>}}

How about 1,000 items and a max age of 10 minutes,

{{<highlight go>}}
mI := 1_000
oMA := time.Minute * 10

sc := simplecache.New[string](simplecache.Option{
    MaxItems: &mI,
    MaxAge:   &oMA,
})
{{</highlight>}}

Lastly how about setting all the possible options.

{{<highlight go>}}
oMi := 1000
oEp := simplecache.LRU
oEs := 5
oMA := time.Second * 60

sc := simplecache.New[string](simplecache.Option{
    MaxItems:        &oMi, // max number of items the cache will hold, evicting on Set, nil for no limit
    EvictionPolicy:  &oEp, // Which eviction policy should be applied LRU or LFU
    EvictionSamples: &oEs, // How many random samples to take from the items to find the best to expire
    MaxAge:          &oMA, // Max age an item can live on Get when past this will be deleted, nil for no expiry
})
{{</highlight>}}

So I yeeted it into searchcode.com's beta and running the normal tests the profile shows all is well again. Happy days and I can get back to working on the SQLite migration.
