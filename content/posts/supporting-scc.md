> I "strongly" suggest that you wrap each product into a paid version - where you sell a "license" for usage with priority support.

New year means new energy and so I got around to do this. All the tools will remain free software, so there is no need to worry about a rug pull. However it does mean I am now offering proper email and if required face time support for every license sold for a year from the data of purchase.

While I am yet to get a marketing page done for this (been back at the work for only a few days) I did go and add links to each of the projects README's and am including the embedded links here to increase the reach.
