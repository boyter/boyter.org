I was a speaker at the first Go meetup in Sydney 2025... the first speaker in fact. As is my habit I am posting my notes for everyone who attended to view them.

I believe it was recorded and will post the link to that if I ever get the link.

You can find the link to the talk based on the blog post [searchcode.com's SQLite database is probably 6 terabytes bigger than yours](https://boyter.org/posts/searchcode-bigger-sqlite-than-you/).
