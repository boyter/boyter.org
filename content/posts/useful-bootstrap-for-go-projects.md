title: Useful bootstrap checklist for Go Projects
date: 2021-06-07

Mostly here because I keep forgetting all the things I want to put into a Go project when I start it. Collected into a list of things I actually need to do, tools to install and how to get things working.

This page is a work in progress and something I will add to as I remember things or discover something new.

### Static Analysis

https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/

Install that and run `golangci-lint run ./...` from the root when checking in.

https://golangci-lint.run/usage/false-positives/

Use the above to mute issues raised such as using `defer` or ignoring json.Marshall errors.

### JSON

If JSON is being used and turns up in traces an easy option is to use the following.

```
import (
    jsoniter "github.com/json-iterator/go"
)

var json = jsoniter.ConfigCompatibleWithStandardLibrary
```

### Run Tests

Remember you need ... spread to have them run recursively.

```
go test ./...
```

### Unique Codes

```
grep -r uniqueCode . | grep -o '"[a-z0-9]*"' | sort | uniq -c | grep -v '  1 '
```

### Logging

Use zerolog for logging. https://github.com/rs/zerolog

For every log message use the following format,

```
log.Error().Str(uniqueCode, "1d0223bc").Err(err).Msg("error with getting user from database")
```

Where uniqueCode is a constant defined somewhere as `uniqueCode` and then for the value use `date | md5 | cut -c 1-8` to generate a unique code.

This allows for quick finding of the line that produced an error or message.

To confirm that unique codes are in fact unique use the following,

```
grep -r uniqueCode . | grep -o '"[a-z0-9]*"' | sort | uniq -c | grep -v '   1 '
```

Which will return values if something is not actually unique.

Setting logging up is pretty simple, with the following,

```
switch strings.ToLower(config.LogLevel) {
case "debug":
    zerolog.SetGlobalLevel(zerolog.DebugLevel)
case "info":
    zerolog.SetGlobalLevel(zerolog.InfoLevel)
case "error":
    zerolog.SetGlobalLevel(zerolog.ErrorLevel)
default:
    zerolog.SetGlobalLevel(zerolog.InfoLevel)
}
```

### Building

Use the following if targetting ARM Linux

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags="-s -w"
```

The build flag is there to reduce the size of the binary.


### Router

Use https://github.com/gorilla/mux and be sure to set the following, 


```
router := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)
```

to ensure that slashes are handled in an expected manner.
